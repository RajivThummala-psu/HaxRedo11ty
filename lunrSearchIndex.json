   "description":"Upon dipping your feet into the behemoth that is web development, you will quickly realize how non-static this field is. Everything is constantly changing and evolving, from updates to web protocols to constant syntax alterations. Consequently, a 1337 developer must periodically update their toolkit with the new fads and revolutions within the industry. With a sector that is never static, it is vital that the fundamentals of web development are mastered to provide a base in expanding a developer&#39;s toolkit. Perhaps one of the most important fundamentals to grasp is the basics of JavaScript. As adumbrated by tutorialspoint:Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc. Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to lear",

   "description":"This will be a brief synopsis and run through on how latitude and longitude coordinates can be detected via GeoIP. Particularly, by feeding IP addresses into the GeoIP API. You can follow along with my github repo. Before we get started, let&#39;s import the necessary dependencies within your project. Since we are going to be wiring up the data to a wikipedia-query tag, we will need to import the following dependency: @lrnwebcomponents/wikipedia-query/wikipedia-query.jsMake sure you are using the right syntaxTo complete the setup process we will also need to do npm install @lrnwebcomponents/wikipedia-queryAs you parse through the constructor repo, you will notice that the first API you run into is: https://freegeoip.app/json/This is the GeoIP API. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the server is down so I am unable to provide an overview of all the services this API offers in particular. However, you can head over to this link to poke around. Deciphering the GeoIP API?You will",

   "description":"First started in 2013, Docker is a set of platform as a service products that leverage OS-level virtualization to deliver software in containers. Containers make it easy to put new versions of software, with new business features, into production quickly-and to quickly roll back to a previous version if you need to. A form of virtualization, one single container can be utilized to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files. Thus, docker is so powerful due to its ability to facilitate the microservice deployment process by leveraging containers to run across different computing environments. To begin, lets ensure that you have a rudimentary understanding of how docker functions. Please run through this tutorial if you are not familiar with docker. If you are not running through the tutorial, ensure that you have your own server through Docker. If",
